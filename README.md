 PERSONAL PORTFOLIO
 
Hey there! I'm Talia Mukami, an IT student based in Kenya, passionate about tech and the countless possibilities it unlocks. This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase who I am, what I’m learning, and the projects I've completed and skills I’ve acquired throughout my tech journey.

 What it entails:
 
This website will include:
- Self-Introduction and sharing a little about my journey in tech.
- Highlight of my current skill set, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C/C++.
- Showcase of my educational background at the University of Embu.
-Moment to share some of my featured projects, built from the knowledge acquired as part of learning and experimenting.
- An opportunity to also download my CV, or just to reach out and say hi.

  The Projects Featured
  
Here are a couple of simple but meaningful beginner projects that reflect my learning so far:
- [Report Card (C Project)] (https://github.com/Tash465/Report-card) – Calculates and displays a student's grades and average marks.
- [Basic Calculator (Python)] (https://github.com/Tash465/calculator.py) – Performs simple math operations between two numbers, such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.

  My Goals
  
I'm still learning, growing, and exploring what excites me most in tech. Right now, I’m focused on:
- Getting better at frontend development.
- Understanding how systems and software come together
- Becoming more confident with real-world problem-solving through practice.
